# Drought-Prediction
`This is a Machine Learning based project that predicts the probability of a region experiencing a drought based on soil and climatic parameters. The algorithm uses historical data on weather and soil parameters to train a model, which can then be used to forecast drought conditions in the future.



`The project uses a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting to generate accurate predictions. The algorithm considers various climatic parameters such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity, along with soil parameters such as soil moisture, soil type, and soil texture.
